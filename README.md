# HR DASHBOARD IN POWER BI PROJECT

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This data analysis and data visualization project is for the management of a fictitious company, Hillspring.

## Business Request:
In recent years, Hillspring Enterprise has had a high turnover and this has negatively affected the business. (Write a bit on the down sides of employee attrition). Management wants to come up with new strategies to improve staff retentions as their current strategies have not been successful. Also, management wants to know how diverse their workforce is, as there was a recent complaint of discrimination by two high performing employees. (write a bit on the advantages of a diverse workforce)
Based on this, the HR manager has requested that the data analyst build a dashbaord which shows the following:
>* An overview of all employees
>* An analysis of employee attrition
>* An analysis of employee diversity

## Business Questions
> * How many employees do we currently have?
> * Who are our employees? 
> * Where are they located?
> * How much do they earn?
> * Why are employees leaving our organisation?
> * What is the age demographic of attritioned employees?
> * How diverse is our organisation?
