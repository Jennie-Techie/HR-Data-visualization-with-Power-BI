# HR DASHBOARD IN POWER BI PROJECT

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This data analysis and data visualization project is for the management of a fictitious company, Hillspring.

### Tools
* **Power BI Desktop**

### This project was built with the following Power BI Desktop components:
* **Power Query**
* **Power Pivot**
* **Power View**


## Business Request:
In recent years, Hillspring Enterprise has had a high turnover and this has negatively affected the business. Management wants to come up with new strategies to improve staff retentions as their current strategies have not been successful. Also, management wants to know how diverse their workforce is, as there was a recent complaint of discrimination by two high performing employees. 
Based on this, the HR manager has requested that the data analyst build a dashbaord which shows the following:
>* An overview of all employees
>* An analysis of employee attrition
>* An analysis of employee diversity

## Business Questions
> * How many employees do we currently have? Where are they located?
> * Who are our employees?
> * How much do we spend annually on staff salaries?
> * Why are employees leaving our organisation?
> * What is the age demographic of attritioned employees?
> * How diverse is our organisation?

### Report Tab 2:
 
**This report page addresses USE CASE 1 and USE CASE 3. It answers the questions'Who are our employees?' and 'How much do we spend annually on staff salaries?'. 
It uses 4 main visuals to show who the current employees are. There are also 4 cards which show the metrics 'Total employees', 'Annual Salaries', 'Total Male' and 'Total Female'. An employee filter is provided so that the user can search for specific employees and get their details.**

### Report Tab 3: 
**This report page addresses the USE CASE 2 which is focused on Attrition Analysis. While it does not directly answer the question 'Why are our employees leaving?', it gives insights into the job level, department, age, service years at the company and the gender of all attritioned employees. Further analysis of the insights in the dashboard would answer the question. The dashboard points management in the direction they should look to know why employees are leaving and also how they can mitigate it.**

### Report Tab 4:
**This report page addresses the USE CASE 4 which is focused on Diverity Analysis. It answers the question 'How diverse is our workforce?' At a glance, the user can see the employee distribution by race, gender, disability, Age/Generation and marital status. All of these metrics would help the management in checking if they have met their diversity target, and they can make better decisions.
